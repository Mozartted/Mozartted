### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About Me
I'm what you'll call a jack of all trades, Master of some, Prolific builder, and somewhat of a workaholic. I like motorcycles and chess ( I wish I could be better at chess though).

I spend an awful amount of time coding and debugging. And more recently I've been working on this new product called Coincord. A side project turned into a full-scale product. I wish I could feature more of it, but you can learn more about Ezrah (ex Coincord) here [https://ezrah.co](https://ezrah.co)

With that said, Here are some interesting things about me.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Coincord, Blockchain-related projects, Opensource Web3 projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Smart contract security.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chibuike-o-85b88aab/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm spending most of my time coding.
