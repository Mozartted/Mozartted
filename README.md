### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### About Me
I'm what you'll call a jack of all trades, Master of most, Prolific builder (Well, On my way to being one), and somewhat of a workaholic. I like motorcycles and chess ( I wish I could be better at chess though).

With that said, Here are some interesting things about me.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Ezrah, Blockchain-related projects, Opensource Web3 projects, Fun Experiements and Rust related things.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Smart contract security, Rust, UI/UX (Re-learning)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm spending most of my time coding.
